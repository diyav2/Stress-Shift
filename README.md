# Stress-Shift
Rehabilitation devices (like braces or exosuits) often provide uniform support, but abnormal gaits (after injury, stroke, ACL tears, etc.) involve non-uniform, dynamic loading patterns that worsen joint stress. Can we design a dynamically adaptive sleeve that redistributes loads to reduce damaging torque at critical gait phases?
